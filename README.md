# üëÅ‚Äçüó® EnvyControl

EnvyControl is a CLI tool that provides an easy way to switch between GPU modes on Nvidia Optimus systems (i.e laptops with hybrid Intel + Nvidia or AMD + Nvidia graphics configurations) under Linux.

### Immutable Fork

<i>This fork is intended to resolve the problem of envycontrol not working properly on immutable distros.  EnvyControl dev has indicated he does not plan to support immutable distros, so now this fork exists.  It is a work in progress and is mostly untested, however it has some confirmed limited functionality on Silverblue 38 running Gnome Wayland.  Hopefully this fork can be helpful for others.</i>

### Limitations

Mostly untested.  Cannot be installed globally (yet?) so only operational via CLI running the python script commands.

### How to run

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/alongwhile/envycontrol-immutable.git`
4. Run the script from the python root: `python ./envycontrol.py -s <MODE>`  Replace `<MODE>` with integrated, hybrid, or nvidia as needed
5. You may see some errors.  Reboot anyway and hope for the best

See <a href="https://github.com/bayasdev/envycontrol">EnvyControl</a> github page for full CLI options, FAQ's, etc.

<b><i>Please report any problems so they can be documented here.  Commit any suggested improvements as needed!  Maybe we can get global install working?</i></b>
